## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
> A company which is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. This company wants to understand the driving factors 
(or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
> The data set is a portfolio of retail loan data spread across a time period from 1960s to early 2000

## Conclusions
- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of loans defaulting and reducing credit losses:Â 
1. Annual Income, 
2. DTI , 
3. Verification Status, 
4. Grades 
5. Loan Amount

- There is a higher probability of loans defaulting in the scenario where:
1.Higher loan amounts (>10,000) are approved on the basis of borrowers having higher annual income or longer duration of employment
2.Higher loan amounts are approved for verified borrowers
3.Loans approved for borrowers with sub prime grades (Lower than C to G)
4.loans are approved for Borrowers with annual income in the range of 25000-75000 which showcase higher DTI (greater than 14)
5.Borrowers are from California, New Jersey and Florida
6.Higher loan amounts(>10,000) are sanctioned for loans towards small business purpose
7.Loans are approved for purpose of debt consolidation and housing with higher term (>4years)
8.Loans are approved for purpose of debt consolidation, credit card and vacation to borrowers with higher DTI (>14)
9.Higher term loans (60 months) are given out
